			Hello there. I'm Aaron Greenwald, and this is my small corner of the web.
			</p>
			<p>
			<h3>About Me</h3>			
			I'm a software developer in the Washington, DC area. 
			The majority of my work experience has been in the .NET universe, but I've recently begun exploring
			a FOSS stack for my personal projects. I currently use PostgreSQL and Python 
			(<a href="http://www.pylonsproject.org/">Pyramid</a>) to develop web apps that 
			can be hosted on Linux. 
</p><p>			
			Since I've begun programming, I've worked on a variety of different kinds of projects. 
			Currently, I'm focused primarily on web development. 
			I'm especially interested in how client-side frameworks can be used to make web apps a viable replacement for desktop apps.
			I've been doing a lot of work with <a href="http://angularjs.org/" >AngularJS</a> recently and I'm starting to believe that although today's client-side frameworks
			don't eliminate the challenges of developing interactive, desktop-like applications for the web, 
			they're a big step forward for the future of computing. Time will tell, of course.
			    </p> <p>
