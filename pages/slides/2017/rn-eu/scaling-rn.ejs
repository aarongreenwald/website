        ** Abstract**

        _React Native is great for developing large applications across multiple teams, but only if you architect your app well.
        See the code and architecture that allows us to have disconnected teams working on separate modules
        but delivering a cohesive product that users feel is just one unified app.

        How many developers do you have working on your React Native app? One? Less than five? 15?
        What if you had over 40? React Native is a good fit for developing large applications across multiple teams in a company,
        but only if you architect your app correctly.

        Less than two years ago, I could count all of the developers working on our app on one hand.
        Now, I don’t even know everyone’s names.
        Learn how we architected the Wix app in a way that allows us to have multiple teams on multiple continents
        working on separate modules but delivering a cohesive product that users feel is just one unified app.

        When we first started building the Wix mobile app with React Native, the team was very small.
        But we knew we’d expand it very quickly, and we knew we’d need a way to allow an increasing
        number of developers to start adding functionality very quickly. Making it even more complicated,
        many of these developers would not be part of the “core team” - they’d come from other parts of the company,
        with their own development schedule, roadmap, and management structures. So it was important to create an architecture
        that would be friendly to distributed development, both in code and in process. At the same time,
        it was important to make sure the app would not feel like a frankestein-like mashup of disconnected modules.

        What we came up with is still in production today (although we’ve certainly iterated upon it).
        I’d like to present it to the community so that others can learn from our experience,
        particularly companies that are large and are considering using React Native to build apps by reusing
        existing web developers that are already distributed in separate departments and business functions._
