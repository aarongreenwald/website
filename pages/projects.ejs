    In general, much of my hobby code can be found on <a href="http://github.com/aarongreenwald">GitHub</a>. This page
    highlights what I'm currently focused on.
    <h3><a href="http://seatstat.com">SeatStat</a></h3>
    SeatStat helps teachers easily create seating plans for their classrooms.
    It's a hobby project I started very recently, so the code's still a mess
    and the direction and longevity of the project is still up in the air.
    It has a python (Pyramid) backend and an AngularJS frontend. Check out 
    the code on <a href="http://github.com/aarongreenwald/seatstat">GitHub</a>
    or the beta app at <a href="http://seatstat.com">www.seatstat.com</a>.

    <h3><a href="https://github.com/aarongreenwald/pim">PIM</a></h3>
    PIM (Personal Information Manager) is a hobby project I occassionally put some work into. 
    It's been a long time with little progress because I keep shifting focus to other things, 
    but at some point I'm hoping to get it to the point where it's usable. 
    The basic idea behind PIM is to have a place to store all kinds of personal data 
    I like to track, from finances and budgeting to a diary to notes. 

    PIM was the first project I started using python on the backend, and I'm using it to
    learn a new stack I can use on a non-Windows environment.
    You can view the code on <a href="http://github.com/aarongreenwald/pim">GitHub</a>.
