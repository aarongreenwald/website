  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
      Over the years, I've done a broad range of application development using a variety of tech. Lately 
      I've developed a strong preference for "fullstack" work because I enjoy building products end-to-end. 
      Things I've worked on professionally:
      <ul>
          <li>Web apps with React and Angular</li>
          <li>Mobile apps with React Native</li>
          <li>Scala server development</li>
          <li>.NET and SQL Server backends</li>
          <li>Nodejs</li>
      </ul>
      I've also lightly used Kotlin in hobby projects, and once upon a time WinForms was my tool of choice.

      A few years ago I moved to Tel Aviv, Israel from Washington, DC. 
      Prior to living in DC, I did time in NYC and Baltimore. I have native-level fluency in English and a working proficiency in Hebrew, 
      as well as a desire to improve my skills in a few other languages. 
      I hold a B.Sc. in Mathematics from Touro College in NY.
