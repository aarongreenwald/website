    In general, much of my hobby code can be found on <a href="http://www.github.com/aarongreenwald">GitHub</a>. This page
    highlights what I'm currently focused on.
    <h3>SeatStat</h3>
    SeatStat helps teachers easily create seating plans for their classrooms.
    It's a hobby project I started very recently, so the code's still a mess
    and the direction and longevity of the project is still up in the air.
    It has a python (Pyramid) backend and an AngularJS frontend. Check out 
    the code on <a href="http://www.github.com/aarongreenwald/seatstat">GitHub</a>
    or the beta app at <a href="http://www.seatstat.com">www.seatstat.com</a>.
