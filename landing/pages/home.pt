    Hello there. I'm Aaron Greenwald, and this is my small corner of the web.

    <h3>About Me</h3>           
    <p>
        I'm a software developer in the Washington, DC area. 
        The majority of my work experience has been in the .NET universe, but I've recently begun exploring
        a FOSS stack for my personal projects. I currently use PostgreSQL and Python 
        (<a href="http://www.pylonsproject.org/">Pyramid</a>) to develop web apps that 
        can be hosted on Linux. 
    </p>
    <p>         
        Since I've begun programming, I've worked on a variety of different kinds of projects. 
        Currently, I'm focused primarily on web development. 
        I'm especially interested in how client-side frameworks can be used to make web apps a viable replacement for desktop apps.
        I've been doing a lot of work with <a href="http://angularjs.org/" >AngularJS</a> recently and I'm starting to believe that although today's client-side frameworks
        don't eliminate the challenges of developing interactive, desktop-like applications for the web, 
        they're a big step forward for the future of computing. Time will tell, of course.
