    <h3>The Details</h3>
    <p>
        I'm a software developer in the Washington, DC area. 
        The majority of my work experience has been in the .NET universe, but I've recently begun exploring
        a FOSS stack for my personal projects. I currently use PostgreSQL and Python 
        (<a href="http://www.pylonsproject.org/">Pyramid</a>) to develop web apps that 
        can be hosted on Linux. 
    </p>
    <p>         
        Since I've begun programming, I've worked on a variety of different kinds of projects. 
        Currently, I'm focused primarily on web development. 
        I'm especially interested in how client-side frameworks can be used to make web apps a viable replacement for desktop apps.
        I've been doing a lot of work with <a href="http://angularjs.org/" >AngularJS</a> recently and I'm starting to believe that although today's client-side frameworks
        don't eliminate the challenges of developing interactive, desktop-like applications for the web, 
        they're a big step forward for the future of computing. Time will tell, of course.

<section id="contact">
    <h3>Contact Me</h3>
    Because I recieve a lot of spam through LinkedIn, I don't usually monitor my inbox there. The best way to reach me is directly via <a class="email-address"> email</a>. (If you send spam to my email inbox, I will probably ignore you as well. Please don't.)
    If you're reading this on a mobile device, you can also download 
    my <a href="/static/aaron-greenwald.vcf">contact card</a>. Depending on how awesome your browser is,
    you may or may not have to open the downloaded file manually.
