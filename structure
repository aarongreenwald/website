Home/
	Blog * (Home page)
	About (brief synopsis, reference to full resume on the site. Home page until blog exists)
	Contact (combine with about?)
	Resume (full resume, each item is expandable for details, also reference to LinkedIn)
	Projects (github, whatever)
	
For now, it's just About, Contact, and Resume. Or just About/Resume. Should I rename resume to bio? Look around a bit.
Serve it static if possible. I can repeat headers on each of the pages. Eventually, I'll need a system for the blog, so I'll use Pyramid.
Until then, I only need one page with hidden content. It loads once. There's not much text, it's all indexed, etc.
A single page for everything except the blog, I think. It'll be tiny. No frameworks necessary.

The blog will have to be a separate page, with a link for each page, dynamically generated. 

So: / 
	 /#about
	 /#contact
	 /#resume
	 /#projects
	 /blog/some-page-title-etc

I'll redo it when there's a blog. Until then, it just makes sense to have one page. Even though it might mean having another library. 
Alternative is two or three pages and the navbar becomes difficult.
