A resume says: I need a job, please help me. 
A business card says: I'm an established professional, let me know if I can assist you.

Landing should not use AngularJS unless I know how to do SEO with it. Serving static for now, but
if it gets to the stage where it's more than a few pages, I'll probably need to use Pyramid to render pages
based on templates and master pages and such. 

Stage 1 - site is essentially a landing space for my name so my business card points somewhere and so 
that no one else can get it. It's a way for people looking for me to find contact info and a bit about me:
/ - Includes About and Contact info
	/resume - should this be called bio? (full resume, each item is expandable for details, also reference to LinkedIn)
	
Addition: Blog
	/blog
	The blog probably takes over the home page, and the home content moves to /about
	The blog should be a standalone application, I think, that sits on /blog. 
Addition: Projects	
	/projects or /code
