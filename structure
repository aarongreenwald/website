Ultimately, it should be: 

/ ??
	/blog
	/about (brief synopsis, reference to full resume on the site. Home page until blog exists)
	/contact (combine with about?)
	/resume (full resume, each item is expandable for details, also reference to LinkedIn)
	/projects (github, whatever)
	
For now, it's just About, Contact, and Resume. Or just About/Resume. Should I rename resume to bio? Look around a bit.
Serve it static if possible. I can repeat headers on each of the pages. Eventually, I'll need a system for the blog, so I'll use Pyramid.
Until then, I only need the simplest thing possible. One page with all the content, and a navbar that shows/hides, might be the solution.
If that's too complicated, it's ok to have two pages: About (Home)/Resume.
I'd love to use Angular for this, but what will the performance and SEO impact be? Mostly because I could use directives for
the resume. The simpler alternative is to just use classes and then javascript to replace the classes with bootstrap or simple
css.

In the single page method, we have:
/ ??
	 /#about
	 /#contact (combine with about?)
	 /#resume 
	 /#projects
	 /blog/some-page-title-etc (I'd need angular to get this on the single page, and it would kill SEO I think.)
	 
We'd use progressive javascript so that all the sections are on the page before javascript runs and google can find them.
I'm not sure how that compares to separate pages.
